# ClimateData_PredictTemperature
Use the climate parameters available measured from different weather stations to predict the Instant Air Temperature at a given time.

First, I use Time Series Interpolation to complete missing data.
Than EDA, choosing the relevent variables for my models and train, predict and tune my models.
The Models use in this projects:
Random Forrest
Adaboost
XGboost

more information can be found in the power point.
